# Ubimote_HR

Ubimote_HR consists of CC2538 with CC2592 for High Range

**CC2538**

The CC2538xFnn is the ideal wireless microcontroller System-on-Chip (SoC) for high-performance ZigBee applications. The device combines a powerful ARM Cortex-M3-based MCU system with up to 32KB on-chip RAM and up to 512KB on-chip flash with a robust IEEE 802.15.4 radio. This enables the device to handle complex network stacks with security, demanding applications, and over-the-air download. Thirty-two GPIOs and serial peripherals enable simple connections to the rest of the board. The powerful hardware security accelerators enable quick and efficient authentication and encryption while leaving the CPU free to handle application tasks. The multiple low-power modes with retention enable quick startup from sleep and minimum energy spent to perform periodic tasks. For a smooth development, the CC2538xFnn includes a powerful debugging system and a comprehensive driver library. To reduce the application flash footprint, CC2538xFnn ROM includes a utility function library and a serial boot loader. Combined with the robust and comprehensive Z-Stack software solutions from TI, the CC2538 provides the most capable and proven ZigBee solution in the market.

**CC2592**

The CC2592 device is a cost-effective and high-performance RF front end for low-power and low-voltage 2.4-GHz wireless applications.

The CC2592 device is a range extender for all CC25XX 2.4-GHz low-power RF transceivers, transmitters, and system-on-chip products from Texas Instruments.

To increase the link budget, the CC2592 device provides a power amplifier for increased output power and an LNA with a low-noise figure for improved receiver sensitivity.

The CC2592 device provides a very small size, high-output power RF design with its 4-mm Ã— 4-mm QFN-16 package.

The CC2592 device contains PA, LNA, switches, RF-matching, and balun for simple design of high-performance wireless applications.

**UbiSense**

UbiSense is the sensor board developed for testing and integrating various sensors with Ubimote_HR. UbiSense contains various sensors that suits for WSN applications where the users can make use of sensor data by plugging in the module directly to the Mote. The Sensors on UbiSense are I2C compatible and user can avail the advantage in interfacing without much trouble.
